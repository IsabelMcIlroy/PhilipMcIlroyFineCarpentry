#Description
This is the first project I completed with Get Coding. It is a desgin for a website my husband will use for his furniture business once he gets that up and running. Once he has finished desiging and proytyping his furniture I will update the website and it will then be a space for him to market his furniture.

#Motivation
My husband is in the planning stadges of starting his own furniture making business and will need a website to showcase his work. I thought this made a useful and intersting project to learn more html and css. Also I learnt this project to learn about using a framework (bootstrap).

#Built with
